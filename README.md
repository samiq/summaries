summaries of books I read, written by me or others

I've always love to read and ever since I graduated from highschool my love for books has increased in quantity as well as in the type of topics I read, from non-fiction to fiction, to everything in between.

this repo serves as a way to share summaries I make as well summaries that others have done that I find worth "formating" to my liking.

maybe it might serve others, but I do it mostly for me.

feel free to send a pull request of interesting summaries you write or find around.

happy reading.
